# Study Buddy Tutor (Agent 1)

The Tutor turns an approved lesson into a beginner-friendly explanation, or reteaches verified missed concepts. This module returns a validated handoff; the controller decides what happens next.

## Parts to learn

| Part | Code | Responsibility |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Harness input | `tutor-input.mjs`, `lessons.mjs` | Load approved content, supply controller IDs, and separate instructions from lesson/feedback data. |
| Prompt | `prompts/tutor-system.md` | Explain or reteach using supplied source text and concept summaries. |
| Provider call | `claude.mjs` | Make one bounded request; reject transport failures and incomplete responses. |
| Agent loop | `tutor.mjs` | Generate, validate, and allow at most one technical repair. |
| Stopping conditions | `tutor.mjs`, `reteaching.mjs` | Reject invalid input before generation; stop on provider failure or exhausted repair; block ineligible reteaching. |
| Handoff checks | `tutor-output.mjs`, `handoff-policy.mjs` | Validate the schema, IDs, sources, concepts, retry focus, and unchanged 10-question/private-answer-key instructions. |
| Tests and evaluation | `*.test.mjs`, `evals/` | Offline regression tests plus separately invoked paid smoke evaluations and human review. |

## Calling the harness

Call `runTutor(context, claudeOptions, repairState)` from `tutor.mjs`. The controller supplies the lesson ID, session ID, handoff ID, and explanation ID. Retry input also requires a verified Assessment return handoff, the trusted current attempt, and the learning retry count.

Success returns `{handoff, model, usage, repairCount}`. `usage` adds reported top-level token counters across completed original and repair responses, including cache counters when supplied. It remains outside the handoff. A `TutorRunError` exposes the failing stage, repair count, and token usage accumulated before failure; unavailable provider usage cannot be estimated.

Technical repair and learning retry are separate. The repair state is consumed before the repair request, even if that request fails. There are at most two model calls in one run. Reteaching is eligible only after a first-round score below 8/10 with an unused learning retry and complete verified weak concepts.

## Run locally

From the repository root, using Node 22+:

```sh
pnpm --dir backend install
pnpm --dir backend test
node backend/evals/run.mjs
```

Offline tests use fake provider responses and do not need an API key. For an explicitly requested paid smoke evaluation, set `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in the ignored root `.env`, then run:

```sh
node --env-file=.env backend/evals/run.mjs --live
```

Never commit `.env` or API keys. See `evals/README.md` for scoring and limitations. Existing live results describe the prompt and code at their recorded run; they do not verify subsequent changes.

## Boundaries still belonging to the controller

This module does not grade quizzes, display screens, save sessions, reserve learning retries durably, or coordinate concurrent requests. The controller must persist and reserve repair/retry state to enforce limits across restarts and concurrent runs. Missing weak concepts are rejected here; their repair workflow belongs to the controller.

Structural validation cannot establish factual accuracy or detect every instruction hidden in otherwise valid explanation prose. Human review checks grounding and teaching quality. The handoff fixes instructions for Assessment, but Assessment must separately enforce its actual quiz size and keep its answer key private.
